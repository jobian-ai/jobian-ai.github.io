<br/><br/><b>Matthew 11</b>
<br/><br/><i>
Matthew 11: 1 When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
2 Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples 3 and said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?” 4 And Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see: 5 the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. 6 And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.”

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How do you personally respond to the concept of not being offended by Jesus? What challenges or struggles do you face in fully embracing him?
2. In what ways can we witness to others about the blessings and eternal life found in Christ, especially in a world where offense towards Christianity is prevalent?
