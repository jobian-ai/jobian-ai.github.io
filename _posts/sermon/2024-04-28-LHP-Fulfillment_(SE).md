<br/><br/><b>Matthew 12</b>
<br/><br/><i> 
Matthew 12: 
15 Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all 16 and ordered them not to make him known. 17 This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:<br/><br/>
18 “Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased.
 I will put my Spirit upon him,
	and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.
<br/><br/>19 He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets;<br/><br/>
20 a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory;<br/><br/>
21 	and in his name the Gentiles will hope.”
