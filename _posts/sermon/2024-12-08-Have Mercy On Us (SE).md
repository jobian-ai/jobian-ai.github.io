<br/><br/><i>
Isaiah 9: 1 But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. 
2 The people who walked in darkness
	have seen a great light;
those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,
	on them has light shone.
3 You have multiplied the nation;
	you have increased its joy;
they rejoice before you
	as with joy at the harvest,
	as they are glad when they divide the spoil.
4 For the yoke of his burden,
	and the staff for his shoulder,
	the rod of his oppressor,
	you have broken as on the day of Midian.
5 For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult
	and every garment rolled in blood
	will be burned as fuel for the fire.
