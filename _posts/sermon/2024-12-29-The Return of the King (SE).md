<br/><br/><i> Matthew 21: 1-11
1 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. 3 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.” 4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,
5 “Say to the daughter of Zion,
‘Behold, your king is coming to you,
 humble, and mounted on a donkey,
 on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’”
6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. 7 They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them. 8 Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 9 And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” 10 And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?” 11 And the crowds said, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”

**Sermon Summary**:
This sermon explores Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem as described in Matthew 21:1-11, emphasizing the paradox of his kingship. Jesus enters humbly on a donkey, fulfilling prophecies that highlight the unexpected nature of God's wisdom. The narrative draws parallels between traditional royal visits, where kings assess their realms, and Jesus' arrival, which serves as both a royal parade and an inspection of spiritual integrity. The sermon contrasts the pomp of earthly kings with Jesus' humility, who comes not with grandeur but with divine authority, symbolized by his choice of transport. It delves into themes of judgment, as Jesus is not only celebrated but also comes to judge Israel's faithfulness. The crowd's acclamation, calling him "Son of David," recognizes him as the Messiah, yet they misunderstand his mission, expecting political restoration rather than spiritual judgment. The sermon also reflects on how this event challenges believers to examine their lives, acknowledging sin, yet embracing the mercy and grace offered through Jesus, who is both judge and advocate.
