<br/><br/><i> Matthew 21: 28-22-14
  Matthew 21
28 “What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’ 29 And he answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind and went. 30 And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but did not go. 31 Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.
33 “Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. 34 When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit. 35 And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. 36 Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. 37 Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 38 But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.’ 39 And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 40 When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” 41 They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.”
42 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:
 “‘The stone that the builders rejected
 has become the cornerstone;
this was the Lord’s doing,
 and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
43 Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. 44 And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.”
45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. 46 And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet.
1 And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, 2 “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, 3 and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. 4 Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’ 5 But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, 6 while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. 7 The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 8 Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. 9 Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’ 10 And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.
11 “But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. 12 And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless. 13 Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 14 For many are called, but few are chosen.”

# Essay on the Sermon

## **The Vineyard, the Feast, and the King**  

If you ask most people what they think the Bible is about, they'll probably say something like, "It's about how to live a good life" or "It's about being moral." That's not wrong exactly, but it's incomplete. A big part of the Bible is about something more subtle: how people respond to authority.  

This passage from Matthew 21 is a case study in that. Jesus tells three parables, one after another, all with the same basic theme: How will people respond to the authority of the Father, the Son, and the kingdom they represent?  

The first parable is about a man with two sons. He tells them to go work in the vineyard. One says, "No," but later changes his mind and goes. The other says, "Yes, sir," but never goes. Jesus asks the obvious question: Which one did the will of the father? The religious leaders answer correctly—it's the first one. But then Jesus drops the hammer: "Tax collectors and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you."  

That would have stung. These were the people who saw themselves as righteous, who thought they were on God's side. But Jesus is saying they’re the second son—the one who says the right things but doesn’t follow through. And the sinners they despised? They’re the first son. They start out far from God but repent when they hear the message.  

Then Jesus tells a second parable, this one darker. A landowner rents out his vineyard to tenants. When it’s time to collect the fruit, he sends his servants, but the tenants beat them, kill them, and send them away. Finally, the landowner sends his son, thinking, “Surely, they’ll respect my son.” But they kill him too, hoping to take the vineyard for themselves.  

Jesus asks the religious leaders what the landowner should do. Their answer? “He’ll bring those wretches to a miserable end and lease the vineyard to others who will give him the fruits.” They don’t realize they’re condemning themselves. Jesus is saying that they’re the wicked tenants, and their rejection of him will result in judgment.  

Finally, Jesus tells a third parable about a king who throws a wedding feast for his son. The invited guests refuse to come. Some make excuses; others kill the messengers. So the king invites everyone—good and bad—to the feast. But when the king finds someone without proper wedding clothes, he throws him out. “Many are called,” Jesus says, “but few are chosen.”  

What’s going on in these stories? On the surface, they’re about how different people respond to God’s authority. But beneath that, they’re about what it means to bear fruit and be part of God’s kingdom.  

### The Vineyard  

The vineyard is a recurring image in the Bible. It represents Israel, God’s people. God planted it, nurtured it, and expects it to bear fruit. But what kind of fruit? Not just obedience to rules. The fruit God desires is deeper—love, mercy, justice, humility.  

The religious leaders thought they were producing fruit by keeping the law. But their fruit was hollow. They cared more about appearances than about truly following God. Meanwhile, the tax collectors and prostitutes—people who seemed hopelessly far from God—heard the message of repentance and bore real fruit.  

### The Feast  

The wedding feast is another picture of the kingdom of God. It’s not just a meal; it’s a celebration, a symbol of the joy and abundance of life with God. But not everyone wants to come.  

Some reject the invitation outright. Others show up but don’t take it seriously—they don’t bother to honor the king with proper wedding clothes. Both groups miss the point. The feast is a gift, but it’s also a call to live in a way that honors the king.  

### What About Us?  

These parables aren’t just stories about the past. They’re for us too. We’re the new tenants of the vineyard, the new guests at the feast. So the question is, how will we respond?  

First, are we bearing fruit? Real fruit, not just going through the motions. Are our lives marked by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control? Are we caring for others, forgiving them, and serving them?  

Second, are we honoring the king? It’s not enough to show up at the feast; we need to come dressed in the righteousness of Christ. That means trusting him, not our own goodness, and living in a way that reflects his character.  

Finally, are we responding to God’s authority with humility? Like the first son, we may start out saying no. But what matters is where we end up. Are we willing to repent, to change, to follow?  

### The Bottom Line  

Jesus’ parables are a challenge and a warning. They remind us that the kingdom of God is a gift, but it’s not one we can take lightly. The invitation is open to everyone, but how we respond matters. Will we reject the king, or will we honor him? Will we bear fruit, or will we squander the vineyard?  

The choice is ours. But the good news is that even if we’ve said no in the past, even if we’ve failed to bear fruit, the invitation is still open. The king is still calling. The feast is ready. Will you come?
