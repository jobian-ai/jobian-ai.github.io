<br/><br/><i> Matthew 22:15-22 Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” They said, “Caesar's.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.

# A Short Essay On This Sermon

## What We Owe

When I was a kid, my neighbor Tom dared me to grab an electric fence. I don’t remember how he phrased it, but it was the kind of dare no little boy wants to back away from. If I said no, I was scared. If I said yes, I was trapped into grabbing it. Either way, Tom won, and I learned that electricity hurts.

The Pharisees and Herodians tried to pull the same trick on Jesus. They came to him with a question designed to trap him: *Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?* Either answer would alienate someone. Say yes, and you’re a Roman sympathizer. Say no, and you’re an insurrectionist. They thought they had him. But they underestimated how good he was at this game.

Jesus didn’t fall into the trap. He asked for a coin and pointed out Caesar’s image on it. “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,” he said, “and to God the things that are God’s.” It’s the kind of answer that makes you pause. The people marveled, and the Pharisees and Herodians left, knowing they’d lost.

What makes this moment so remarkable isn’t just that Jesus avoided the trap. It’s that he reframed the question entirely. By shifting the focus to the image on the coin, he reminded everyone listening of a deeper truth: what belongs to Caesar is trivial compared to what belongs to God.

## The Trap of False Choices

The Pharisees and Herodians weren’t just trying to trick Jesus. They were malicious. Malice is rarely about rage; it’s calculated. It uses flattery, craftiness, and premeditation. They didn’t care about the answer. They cared about the trap. That’s what makes malice so dangerous—it hides its true intent.

But Jesus wasn’t fooled. He didn’t argue on their terms. Instead, he exposed the false choice. The coin? That’s Caesar’s. It has his name on it. Give it back to him if he wants it. But what about you? Whose image is on you? That’s the real question.

## Whose Image Do You Bear?

In the ancient world, coins bore the image of the one who ruled. Caesar’s image was stamped on his coins, and those coins were a constant reminder of his power. But Jesus’ answer subtly turned this on its head. If Caesar’s image on a coin means it belongs to him, then what does it mean that we are made in the image of God? Whose are we?

This is the heart of what Jesus was saying. Caesar might own the coins, but God owns everything else—our hearts, our minds, our souls. Jesus wasn’t just teaching about taxes. He was redefining authority itself. Governments might demand taxes, but God demands everything.

It’s easy to focus on the first part of Jesus’ statement—render to Caesar. That’s practical. It feels like something we can understand and debate. But the second part—render to God—cuts deeper. It asks more of us. What do we owe God? Everything.

## The Real Insurrection

The Pharisees and Herodians thought they were in control, but they were the real rebels. They weren’t giving to God what belonged to him: their loyalty, their faith, their lives. Jesus wasn’t the insurrectionist—they were. They refused to recognize the king standing right in front of them.

This is the same struggle we face. We might not be asking trick questions, but we’re just as good at avoiding the truth. We hold on to things that aren’t ours. We act like our lives are our own. But God’s image is stamped on us. We belong to him.

The beauty of Jesus’ answer is how it puts everything in its place. Money? Just a tool. Governments? Temporary. But God’s kingdom? Eternal. When we give to God what is his, we step into something far greater than anything Caesar could offer.

## Marveling at the King

The story ends with a simple line: “They marveled.” And no wonder. Jesus didn’t just avoid their trap; he exposed their hearts. He showed them what mattered most.

That’s what’s so compelling about Jesus. He isn’t swayed by appearances or flattery. He doesn’t play along with the games people try to trap him in. He cuts straight to the heart. And when you see that, you can’t help but marvel.

So here’s the question: do we marvel at the king? And more importantly, are we giving to him what is his? Because if we truly belong to him, then everything changes.
