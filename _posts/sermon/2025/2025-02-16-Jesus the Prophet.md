<br/><br/><i> Matthew 23
1 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 2 “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat, 3 so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. 4 They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. 5 They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, 6 and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues 7 and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. 8 But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. 9 And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. 10 Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. 11 The greatest among you shall be your servant. 12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
13 “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.
16 “Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.’ 17 You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? 18 And you say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.’ 19 You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? 20 So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. 21 And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it. 22 And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.
23 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. 24 You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!
25 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. 26 You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean.
27 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people’s bones and all uncleanness. 28 So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
29 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, 30 saying, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ 31 Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. 32 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. 33 You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? 34 Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, 35 so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. 36 Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.
37 “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! 38 See, your house is left to you desolate. 39 For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’”

# An Essay about this Sermon

## The Pharisee in the Mirror

Have you ever met someone who seemed to have it all figured out? Someone who always had the right answer, the perfect solution, the impeccable life? You listen to them talk, and you can't help but feel a little inadequate. Maybe even a little envious.

But then you get to know them better. You see behind the facade. You realize that their perfect life is just that: a facade. Underneath, they're just as flawed as the rest of us. Maybe even more so.

This is the picture Jesus paints of the Pharisees in Matthew 23. They were the religious elite of their day, the experts in God's law. They were admired and respected by the people. But Jesus saw through their act. He saw their hypocrisy, their pride, their self-righteousness.

And he warns us not to be like them.

It's easy to read this passage and think, "Well, I'm not a Pharisee. I don't have a holier-than-thou attitude." But the truth is, we all have a little bit of Pharisee in us. We all have a tendency to judge others, to focus on outward appearances, to be more concerned with being right than being loving.

The Pharisees were obsessed with the minutiae of the law. They tithed their spices, but they neglected the weightier matters of justice, mercy, and faithfulness. They cleaned the outside of the cup, but inside they were full of greed and self-indulgence.

They were like whitewashed tombs, beautiful on the outside but full of dead men's bones on the inside.

Jesus calls them "blind guides," "hypocrites," and "serpents." He pronounces seven woes on them, each one a scathing indictment of their hypocrisy and self-deception.

It's a sobering picture. And it's a warning to us all.

We need to be careful not to fall into the same trap as the Pharisees. We need to be more concerned with our own hearts than with the outward appearances of others. We need to be more concerned with loving God and loving our neighbor than with being right.

The Pharisees were so focused on their own righteousness that they missed the Messiah standing right in front of them. They were so busy judging others that they failed to see their own need for salvation.

Don't let that be us.

Let's be honest with ourselves about our own flaws and shortcomings. Let's be quick to forgive others and slow to judge. Let's be more concerned with being humble and compassionate than with being right.

And let's always remember that the only way to escape the judgment of God is to repent of our sins and put our faith in Jesus Christ. He is the only one who can make us clean on the inside. He is the only one who can give us true righteousness.

So let's not be Pharisees. Let's be followers of Jesus. Let's be people of integrity, sympathy, and humility. Let's be people who are more concerned with loving God and loving others than with being right.

That's the kind of life that truly honors God.
