<br/><br/><i> Matthew 24
1 Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. 2 But he answered them, “You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”
3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” 4 And Jesus answered them, “See that no one leads you astray. 5 For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. 6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.
9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake. 10 And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. 11 And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. 12 And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
15 “So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand), 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, 18 and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. 19 And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! 20 Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. 22 And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. 23 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. 24 For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you beforehand. 26 So, if they say to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. If they say, ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. 27 For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28 Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.
29 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
32 “From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. 33 So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. 34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

# An Essay about this Sermon

# The End of the Age

I was at a funeral last week. Whenever I'm at a funeral, I'm reminded of how we deal with death. Most people avoid thinking about it. But if you're a thinking person, you eventually ask: what happens when I die? It's a natural question.

There's another question, though, that's even bigger and less frequently considered: how does the world end? People have various theories. When I was growing up during the Cold War, we lived with the constant possibility of nuclear annihilation. Others imagine meteors or climate disasters. Christians throughout history have speculated about the return of Christ and the end times.

In Matthew 24, we find Jesus discussing exactly this topic with his disciples. It's a private conversation that we're privileged to witness—like being a fly on the wall for a discussion about the end of the age.

To understand the context, Jesus has just had a tense confrontation with the religious leaders in the temple. He's called out the Pharisees as hypocrites, declared woes upon them, and wept over Jerusalem. This was clearly a sad, difficult day for him—he faced attacks and the painful recognition that his people had rejected God.

As they're leaving the temple, his disciples make what seems like an odd comment. They point out how beautiful the temple buildings are. It's as if they're trying to lighten the mood or change the subject after all the tension of the day.

Jesus responds with something jarring: "You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."

Imagine your child pointing out a beautiful building, and you responding, "It's going to be rubble in a few years. Your whole way of life is going to be destroyed." That's essentially what Jesus does here.

Later, when they're sitting on the Mount of Olives overlooking the city, the disciples follow up privately. They ask him: "When will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"

What emerges from Jesus's answer are two focal points. One is near—the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. The other is far—the second coming of Christ and final judgment. The first would be experienced in the disciples' lifetimes. The second is what we as Christians still await today.

What Jesus is saying is profound: the age they were living in—with the temple as the center of worship, the sacrificial system, the law as understood by the Pharisees, the earthly kingdom of Israel where God's presence dwelt—that entire age was coming to an end.

Why? Because Christ would fulfill all of it. He would be the true temple, mediating between God and man. He would be the perfect sacrifice, eliminating the need for more sacrifices. He would be the perfect high priest, making the temple unnecessary. He would be the living Word of God, showing how to live. And he would pour out his Spirit on his people, making the ceremonial and civil aspects of the law unnecessary. He would be king of a heavenly kingdom that can't be destroyed—a kingdom that will one day be the only kingdom.

But for this new age to begin, the old age had to end. This must have been painful for the disciples to hear. They had expected the Messiah to restore Israel's glory, to drive out the Romans, to make Israel great again. Instead, Jesus was saying the temple would be destroyed. Talk about an unwelcome message.

So the disciples want to know when. And Jesus answers by describing some warning signs:

First, there will be false messiahs and false prophets—people claiming to be saviors, leading many astray.

Second, there will be wars, natural disasters, famines, and earthquakes—nothing new, but happening with greater intensity. Jesus calls these "birth pangs"—signs that something is coming.

Third, there will be persecution. Christians will be delivered up to tribulation, put to death, and hated by all nations. Some will fall away and betray the church under pressure. Some will be led astray by false Christs. Some will find their love for God growing cold. "Why doesn't he do something about all this suffering?" they'll ask. "Maybe there's nothing to this faith after all."

Fourth, there will be the "abomination of desolation" standing in the holy place—perhaps referring to the Roman general who would enter the temple, or to the Jewish zealots who fought a civil war within the temple precincts, or even to the religious leaders themselves, whom Jesus had just called robbers and hypocrites.

The overall message is clear: there will be tribulation. Things will get intense. But it won't last forever—it will be "cut short."

Jesus tells his disciples not just what will happen, but what they should do. It's like a mother who spots hail falling and calls her children inside. She reads the signs and takes action. Jesus wants his disciples to do the same.

First, they should watch. They should learn from the fig tree: when it puts out leaves, summer is near. Likewise, when they see these signs, they'll know the end of the age is approaching.

Second, they should not be led astray. Despite trials, persecutions, and wars, they must stay focused.

Third, when the time comes, they should flee Jerusalem. When they see the Roman armies approaching, they should get out.

Fourth, they should endure to the end. Following Jesus won't be easy. In fact, it will make life more difficult. But they must persevere.

Finally, they should pray for God's help through these tumultuous times.

But Jesus doesn't end with destruction. He also declares how this age will end—and a new one will begin. Even as the temple is being destroyed, the kingdom of Christ will be established.

"This gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations," Jesus says. The gospel will go forward to all nations. The elect will be gathered from the four winds. The nations will mourn as they look on the one they have pierced—as happened at Pentecost, when people from many nations heard Peter preach and were "cut to the heart."

Jesus is declaring both an end and a beginning. The language he uses—the sun darkened, the moon not giving light, stars falling—is the same language the prophets used to describe God's judgment on Babylon and Egypt. Now it applies to Jerusalem. The old order is ending, and a new one—with Christ enthroned in heaven—is beginning.

What does all this mean for us today?

First, Jesus Christ is reigning now. We are part of his kingdom. We are ambassadors of Christ, the light of the world, the salt of the earth. We belong to him—he protects us, guides us, and keeps us to the end of our days.

Since Christ is reigning now, every one of us will bow before him as King. Every person will face him one day. Will we face him as rebels, like those religious leaders? Or will we rejoice in him as Lord? There is time to repent and follow Jesus. As sure as Jesus's words were about Jerusalem, so they are about his ruling and reigning as king and judge of all. Don't reject him. Receive him as your king.

Second, the call to those early Christians is our call too. We live in our own tumultuous time in a fallen world, waiting for its final redemption when Christ returns. We are to endure, to pray, to watch, to wait, to take action.

As the writer of Hebrews encourages us: "Take care, brothers, lest there be in you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called 'today,' that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end."

Let's endure together. Life is difficult. We are jars of clay, living in a world that's tumultuous, violent, lawless, full of greed, arrogance, selfishness, anxiety, and moral decay. But the church stands as a place of light and life in the world, because we have the gospel—the treasure that brings light and life to the heart.

May we be faithful to the one who has given us that treasure. May we speak of the gospel often and freely. May our eyes be fixed on Christ our King. May our hearts be completely devoted to him and not tied to the things of this world. And may we wait and watch with great anticipation for that glorious day when Christ returns and all is set right.
