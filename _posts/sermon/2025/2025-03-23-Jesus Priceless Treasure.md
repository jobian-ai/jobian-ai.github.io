<br/><br/><i> Matthew 26:1-16

"**The Plot to Kill Jesus**

26 When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, 2 “You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.”

3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, 4 and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. 5 But they said, “Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.”

**Jesus Anointed at Bethany**

6 Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,[a] 7 a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table. 8 And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste? 9 For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor.” 10 But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. 11 For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. 12 In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial. 13 Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”

Judas to Betray Jesus
14 Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 15 and said, “What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?” And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. 16 And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him."

## Living Hope PCA Sermons: Matthew 26-1-16 -  Jesus, Priceless Treasure


### An Essay about this Sermon

# Jesus, Priceless Treasure

There’s something funny about value. We think we know what something is worth, but the truth is, we’re guessing most of the time. And we're usually wrong.

A thing’s real value only becomes clear when you're forced to trade something for it.

That’s what this part of Matthew is about. The moment when the price tags start showing up. A jar of ointment. Thirty silver coins. A human life. And, at the center of it all, Jesus.

***

For a long stretch, Jesus’ ministry is mostly teaching. Crowds gather. People are healed. The disciples are learning—slowly. The tone is hopeful. But as you get to the last part of Matthew, the story shifts. Jesus starts talking about death. His death.

That’s not what the disciples want to hear. They liked the King-on-a-throne version of Jesus. The one with angels and glory. But this other version—the one who keeps talking about being “delivered up” and crucified—makes them uncomfortable. It’s easier to nod and hope He’s being metaphorical.

He’s not.

Jesus says it plainly: the Passover is coming, and He is going to be crucified. Not “maybe.” Not “if things go badly.” He knows. He names it. He’s not avoiding it, and He’s not trying to escape. He’s walking straight into it. The one with all the authority is choosing the cross.

That, already, tells you something about what He values.

***

Meanwhile, in a palace across town, there’s a meeting going on. Caiaphas, the high priest, is huddled with other powerful men. Their plan is simple: get rid of Jesus. But do it quietly. He’s too popular. Do it after the festival. Let things calm down first.

Their whole conversation has the vibe of people who think they’re in charge.

They’re not.

They think they’re plotting in secret, but the real plan is already unfolding—and it doesn’t belong to them. It’s not that their power doesn’t matter. It’s that it’s not ultimate. Every age has its Caiaphases—smart, connected, careful people who know how the world works. But the arc of the story isn’t shaped by the people in palaces. It’s shaped by the person no one thinks is holding the controls.

The one heading to the cross.

***

And then the camera pans to a very different place. A house. Not a palace. A man named Simon, who used to be a leper, is hosting a meal. Jesus is there. And suddenly, a woman—unnamed, unnoticed—walks up with an alabaster jar of ointment. Very expensive. She breaks it open and pours it on Jesus’ head.

And the room goes quiet.

You can feel the tension. The disciples are annoyed. “Why this waste?” they say. You could’ve sold it. Given the money to the poor. Helped someone. Done something useful.

But Jesus stops them. “She has done a beautiful thing to Me.” He doesn’t mean useful. He means something else. Something almost forgotten in a world that only understands utility. Beauty.

That’s the moment when you realize what the woman understood and everyone else missed: Jesus is worth everything.

She got it. Not with words, but with action. She didn’t just say He was priceless. She showed it. A year’s wages poured out in one extravagant moment. And Jesus says this act—this simple, lavish, uncalculated act—will be remembered wherever the Gospel is told.

She didn’t know she was preparing Him for burial. But He did.

***

In the same room, another person is watching. Judas. He sees the ointment poured out, and it lands with a different kind of weight. Waste, he thinks. That could’ve been money. That *should* have been money.

And that’s when he decides he’s done.

He goes to the chief priests. “What will you give me if I deliver Him to you?” They say: thirty pieces of silver. Not a random number. That was the going price for a slave.

He takes it.

In the span of a few verses, two people put a value on Jesus. One thinks He’s worth everything. The other thinks He’s worth a bit less than a used ox. The contrast is almost too sharp. But that’s the point. That’s what Matthew wants us to see.

What is Jesus worth?

***

It’s easy to say we value Him. Most people would. Especially if you’re already in church. But what we *do* tells the real story. The disciples talked a lot about how great Jesus was, but in that moment, when something actually costly was poured out, they called it a waste.

It’s not that they hated Jesus. It’s that they didn’t love Him *enough.*

They didn’t think He was worth *that* much.

That’s where Judas was too. He had followed Jesus for years. Seen miracles. Heard every sermon. But in the end, he saw an opportunity to cash out. Jesus wasn’t getting him where he wanted to go, so he took the money and moved on.

The same thing still happens. Maybe not as obviously. But it happens whenever someone decides that Jesus is nice to have around, but not enough to build your whole life around. Not enough to reorder your priorities. Not enough to be your *treasure.*

***

The woman never says a word in the story. We don’t know her name. We don’t get her backstory. But she understood something no one else did: Jesus was going to die. And He was worth everything.

That’s the difference.

A lot of people respect Jesus. A few admire Him. But there’s a very narrow road between respect and worship. Most people never take it. She did.

Jesus called her gift *beautiful.* Not because it was efficient. Not because it met a need. But because it matched the moment. She saw who He was—and responded accordingly. That’s what made it beautiful.

***

The hard part is, we’re always valuing things. Not in theory. In real life. Where we spend our money. How we spend our time. What we sacrifice for. What we protect. What we chase. That’s how you know what you really value.

And at some point, Jesus will put Himself in that calculation.

Not to demand payment. But to ask, gently, where He stands.

Some people—like Judas—will realize He isn’t at the top. And they’ll walk away. Others—like the woman—will see that no cost is too high. That He’s worth more than their savings account, more than their reputation, more than their future plans.

More than anything.

And that’s what makes the Gospel feel like a kind of reversal. Because the only one who is truly priceless is the one who’s treated like He’s worth nothing. He’s traded. Rejected. Crucified. Not because He couldn’t stop it, but because He *wouldn’t.*

That’s what it cost Him to buy *us.*

Which means if you're wondering what you're worth to God, you don’t have to guess. He already told you. Thirty silver coins couldn’t buy you. A jar of perfume wouldn’t be enough. Only a cross could do it.

And He paid it.

So the question comes back again: what is Jesus worth to you?

There’s a hymn that calls Him “Jesus, priceless treasure.” You can only sing that line truthfully if you’ve already done the math. If you’ve looked at everything else and found it lacking. If you’ve poured something out and felt the cost. If you’ve seen the beauty in the cross—not just what it means, but who it’s for.

That’s when the words become real.

Jesus, priceless treasure.

It sounds like poetry. But it’s also just the truth.
