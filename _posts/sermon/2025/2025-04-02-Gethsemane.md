<br/><br/><i> Matthew 26:36-56
36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.” 37 And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. 38 Then he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.” 39 And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.” 40 And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, “So, could you not watch with me one hour? 41 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” 42 Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.” 43 And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 44 So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. 45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”

47 While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. 48 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.” 49 And he came up to Jesus at once and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” And he kissed him. 50 Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you came to do.” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. 51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. 53 Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? 54 But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?” 55 At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. 56 But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled.

### An Essay about this Sermon

**The Gap Between Intention and Action**

We've all had the experience of wanting to do something, really wanting to, and then failing. It's a familiar gap, the one between our intentions, which can feel so strong and true, and our actual ability to follow through. Reading about the disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane, you see this gap laid bare in a particularly stark way. They genuinely believed they would stand by Jesus, even to death. They said so, emphatically. But when the moment came, they all fell asleep, and then fled.

It's easy to judge them, to see their failure as a lack of commitment. But maybe it's more about the inherent weakness of being human. They _wanted_ to be loyal. They likely pictured themselves as brave and steadfast. But when faced with the reality of Jesus' sorrow, and perhaps their own fear, their good intentions simply weren't enough. Their "flesh was weak," as Jesus himself put it.

This resonates beyond religious contexts. How many times have we set out to achieve something, full of enthusiasm, only to find our resolve fading when things get difficult? We intend to exercise regularly, to learn a new skill, to finish that project. The desire is there, but the execution often falls short. Life gets in the way, or we simply lack the inner strength to push through.

The disciples' experience also highlights the profound loneliness that can come with bearing a heavy burden. Jesus, facing immense suffering, asked his closest friends to watch and pray with him. He needed their support, even just their presence. But they couldn't even stay awake. It's a painful image, the one of someone facing a monumental task feeling utterly alone, even among those who care about them.

And then there's the idea of the "cup" that Jesus prayed about. It represents something deeply difficult, something he wished to avoid if possible, yet ultimately accepted as necessary. This speaks to a larger truth about facing challenges. Often, the things we need to do are the hardest things, the ones we instinctively want to turn away from. But there's a sense that these difficult paths, these "cups" we must drink, are sometimes the only way forward, the only way to fulfill a larger purpose.

The disciples' story, in this light, isn't just a historical account. It's a reminder of the common human struggle to bridge the gap between our aspirations and our actions. We might have the best intentions, the strongest desires, but our human limitations often get in the way. And sometimes, the most profound and necessary tasks are those we face alone, even when surrounded by others who mean well. It's a sobering thought, but also a strangely comforting one, to know that this struggle is a fundamental part of the human condition.
